Stand alone installation:
- Install everyting
- Run database creation script that will ask for admin password

From the web interface
- Configure email sending (local delivery or using an SMTP server)
- Admin can add user
- Move all the dwimmer pages to be under /_dwimmer/
- Allow creating and editing of pages.
  each page should have
  1) body text
  2) list of comma separated tags
  3) title

- Use a very simple markup language and allow any HTML.
  [linkname]
  [linkname link title]
  [schema://specialcase]
  [schema://specialcase link title]

- When arriving at a page that does not exist yet,
  display this info and if the user is logged in then offer the page
  to be edited/created.

- Maybe add groups and group permissions?


- From the web site allow the creation of a site with basic usage.
  - At first only the admin can create sites but later we might allow
    regular users as well to create sites using the main site.


Allow the admin to disable a user or even to delete it? Or we rather keep the user around for accounting purposes.
