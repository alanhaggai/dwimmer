Stand alone installation:
- Install everyting
- Run database creation script that will ask for admin password



TODO before minimal usability as in-house wiki
==============================================
- Restrict html to minimal interesting
- Landing on a page that does not exist yet? show error OK
  (if the referer is internal and if user is logged it offer creation?. otherwise just show error?)
- Show diff ???
- Set older version to be the newest
- allow only lowercase usernames or at least make them unique in a case insensitive way


TODO - personal one page editor
================================



TODO: Misc
===============
- allow each user to write free text in a profile.
- add multiple e-mail addresses


TODO: Authorization
===============
- Groups and authorization, each site should be able to allow/disallow users to do things on their site
  but there are some global permissions so we might need to have two tables:
user - global_permission
user - site - permission

  - Super dupper - initial user belongs to this, can do anything anywhere (or maybe just admin tasks?)
  - can comment


- users
- groups (that can hold either users or other groups)
- actions (comment, edit page)

- each page has its properties
  1) a blog page normally has one editor but allows comments
  2) a wiki page normally can be edited by anyone and has no comments (though it could)
- each site can have global


TODO From the web interface
=======================
- Configure email sending (local delivery or using an SMTP server)
- Admin can add user
- Move all the dwimmer pages to be under /_dwimmer/
- Allow creating and editing of pages.
  each page should have
  1) body text
  2) list of comma separated tags
  3) title

Markup language
=====================
- Use a very simple markup language and allow any HTML.
  [linkname]
  [linkname link title]
  [schema://specialcase]
  [schema://specialcase link title]

- When arriving at a page that does not exist yet,
  display this info and if the user is logged in then offer the page
  to be edited/created.


- From the web site allow the creation of a site with basic usage.
  - At first only the admin can create sites but later we might allow
    regular users as well to create sites using the main site.


Allow the admin to disable a user or even to delete it? Or we rather keep the user around for accounting purposes.
